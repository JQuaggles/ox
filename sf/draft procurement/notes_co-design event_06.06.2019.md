# Co-Designed Procurement Day | June 6, 2019 

## Smithsonian Institution (SI) National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC)

__Welcome remarks by representatives from NMAAHC/SI:__
-	Excited about this is unique opportunity 
-	This is an important initiative that we hope can help us get to the best possible product vision which, if implemented successfully, will get us to the best product.
-	The goal is for the whole museum is to be online, change the way museums and the public interact; and that goal is as important as building this museum 
-	The content is the key; rich and layered story and the scholarship is the most important aspect
-	How do we deliver that content in a meaningful and interactive way 
-	There is representation from various departments and stakeholders in attendance today: including, project management, finance, education, legal, IT, representatives from other museums, procurement POCs for CIO office, etc
-	Our ultimate goal is to make our work available for the world 

__Overview of Co-designed Procurement by USDS representative__
-	We are government not contractors
-	There are number of things we want to get through today
-	General housekeeping
    *	Refrain from your electronic devices throughout this program, with the exception of lunch
    * There are assigned seating and we will periodically ask folks to move around
    * Post-it notes and markers are on every table
-	We are all here for different reasons. What we here to do today is change the procurement process works
-	We will have USDS facilitator to moderate and guide us throughout the day and the various exercises. 
-	This is not a design workshop focused on the solution, rather a process workshop to better understand gaps and pain-points in the procurement process
-	The objective is to empower the procurement process from both ends
-	This is an experiment with the hope of delivering a good product
-	But you all are contributing to making procurement better in government 
-	The product from today will be available today 

__First Exercise__  
_In the first exercise participants were asked to jot down a series of single words that captured their experience/reaction from the guided tour of the Slavery and Freedom exhibit earlier that morning._

    *	For us, what is the action we are taking, audience and what is the outcome?
      * Reinvest in tech infrastructure to digitizing the whole experience and the exhibit experience/content
      * Make it available and online and searchable
      * Make this experience available to all
      * We are focusing on the Slavery and Freedom exhibit as it is foundational for understanding all other exhibits within NMAAHC
      * How do we translate that impact to online – that experience, that feeling
      * Translating that experience to new audiences 

USDS Representative reviewed digital service maturity assessment

### Second Exercise
_In the second exercise, the participants (both SI and industry) were asked to develop open ended problem statements._  
* Each table discussed the following topics:
  * What do we know now
  * What do we know we don’t know,
  * What are the “gotcha’s”/unknown unknowns, and
  * Assumptions 

Read out from the activity above:  

Table 1:  
-	What do we know: 
    * Current status – visiting audience, capacity of staff, what are you past failures, what’s working not working and why, share how you manage your data
    * We want to be iterative – small failures
    * Do you (SI) know your social media footprint
    * What assets are in hand we can leverage
    * The subject matter is a difficult area; need time to decompress
-	What do we know we don’t know:
    * Audience – are we attracting new people, past visitors, etc
    * Stakeholders – to what degree each are in agreement and supportive
    * Different styles of communication needed to engage as many people
    * Emotional impact at home
    * What current events/landscape someone comes in with
    * What are the performance metrics
    * Change management as digital maturity; how will that be managed
    * MVP – what does that even look like? Is it the entire slave and freedom exhibit or focused subsection of that?
-	What do we don’t know we don’t know (unknown unknowns)
    * What is the appetite for embracing failure
    * Security challenges
    * Future techs that might come out and how will that fit into the ecosystem here
    * Desired impact
    * How are we going to moderate content
    * Human psychology – how are we going tap in to the human mind to deliver this message differently to each visitor? 

Table 2     
-	Overviewed some high level notes + lingering questions
-	Known knowns
    * Limitations to access 
    * Curator notes
    * What can we change and optimize
    * Access to users
    * Single point of decision
    * Point the vendor in right directions
    * Procurement questions
-	Unknowns – There is a lot of unknowns
    * is it for people who have been here or new 
    * We need to figure out what the scope is 
    * What does success look like 
    * Appetite for including agile design 
    * Desired success – for users and biz/museum
    * What does this award look like 
    * Is there a desire to do extensive research 
    * What is the main driver – a launch date? If yes, why?
    * What does success look for each SI and NAAH and both 

Table 3  
-	Known Knowns
    * Replicate feeling vs 1st person experience
      * Meta data is well curated but how do you deliver that digitally
    * What is the current digital experience
    * What is the number trying to reach 
    * Current outreach efforts, if any
-	Unknown knowns  
    * TRB process
    * ATO process 
    * Backend systems that need to be pulled
    * What is the thing we need to get from people 
    * What does present growth look like
    * Is there an existing branding strategy 
    * What are the accessibility needs – language, for example
    * What content is already ready vs needs to built
-	Unknown unknowns  
    * What is “digitizing”
    * Does it connect with current in-person exhibit or is it an extension of existing exhibit(s)
    * How does open web content apply 
    * What is tech advancement vs reachability 
    * Is there an expectation from congress, funder, donors, other stakeholders, etc 
    * If so, what is that expectation

SI noted here that some of these questions could be addressed today but some would require the museum think through and make decisions. However, SI also noted that would be better at answering more about what is NOT.  

Table 4  
-  Known knowns:
    * Expectation to match museum’s grant?
    * Replicate the current impact of exhibit
    * Existing current audience
    * Existing museum data and security
    * MVP will be in English
-  Known unkown / what we know we don’t know  
    * Don’t know what the project will cost
    * Accessibility needs
    * Don’t know the digital product audience – accessibility needs
    * TRB tech review process
    * Self-directive learning 
    * Timeline we will meet is 12 months
    * How to replicate the experience digitally 
    * Licensing issues for the exhibits
    * Connecting to other museums 
-  Unknown unknowns

    * Social media outcomes? 

Table 5
-	Known knowns
    * Work with existing systems
    * Have 1 year from start date
    * Funding for first year from donor
    * Educator needs to be in play – focused on schools
    * Mirror the museum experience
    * This project will be very dependent on UX research
    * Like to be scalable 
    * Can we update and maintain museum stack 
    * Portable, flexible product
    * Make it available for other language audience
    * Can we build in usage analytics
    * Complex time consuming initiative
    * SI has an initiative on “open access” – how do we build a product that will embrace these open values
      * Everything in the web; under open access subset will avail 
      * All metadata is considered open
      * Noncommercial use, high resolution 
      * Ton of enthusiasm from public
      * Transformative, unique, and we (SI) internally want to follow agile methodology 
-	Unknown knows
    * Don’t know what the end product will look like
    * Long term relationship with the vendor
    * We don’t how to incorporate outside support
-  Unknown unknowns
    * No single product owner
    * Shifting leadership 
    * More expectation form donor(s)
    * External delays
    * Will this be even used by anyone
    * Shifting thinking process – we don’t know how it will impact our internal process, how we look at our collections, unclear if it will make our collections better 

### Q & A  
-	Q: donor requirements – helpful to have more info regarding constraints / describe in detail the experience we are looking to capture, interviews and quotes, etc. 
-	Q: Sounds like you could end up with 2 different museums and experiences; what does the job of a curator look like – one for in-person and digital 
    * We are focusing on digital humanities 
    * The curators job doesn’t stop in the exhibit room 
    * How we can convey this message, story, feeling, etc. to online is not limited to someone who does digital humanities 
    * There are already physical constraints for curating in building
    * Providing deeper information may be disruptive / impossible to do in building 
    * Audience = include people who can’t come but another set of audience is also the person who does come but needs more information 
    * Get people to get thinking about how to connect all the history 
    * Limitation of the space = translates to people take picture of labels
-	Q (from industry): how do we support and embrace this ambiguity and come out with vision that captures the experience and enough ambiguity to innovate / enough constraint to bid on it. This requires a partnership, we have desire to dive into ambiguity. We need the freedom to help you (SI) get the best solution 
-	A (SI finance / procurement representative)
    * Ambiguity, scope creep, alignment on procurement came up. These are all legit concerns. Let me address some of these
    * Has anyone worked with this museum? (most people in the room answered “no”)
    * Learn about this new process the museum is doing 
    * Basic guidelines with respect to working w/ the Smithsonian
      * General framework: each institution is independent / different levels of IT but there some central SI projects
      * Different types of funding with diff constraints
    * If not registered with SAM, please do so
    * The SI has it is own vendor registration 
      * Alignment on procurement –
        * We have front level procurement, contract and procurement in the room, 
        * We want to be easy to work with 
        * In the front end there has to be agreement on SCOPE and BUDGET
        * Looking for USDS to help us on the front end with getting the RFQ/RFP released
        * When contract rolls out there will be one person assigned (COTR) major change to scope or price needs to be agreed upon on paper/ in writing 
        * When we get a deal we will get a purchase order – the name on the invoice has to match the account. Usually payment goes thru within 30 days
o	Q (from industry) How do we talk about outcomes as scopes – what are tangible scopes, as opposed to output – 
o	A (from SI)
    * Leaning on USDS for support
    * Valid questions – we will provide  guidance on this
o	Can we build in start and stop points milestones in the project to ensure that we building the right product the right
o	If we are doing milestones we will do milestone payment, generally SI doesn’t do lump sum payment upfront 
o	How do you build contract out of outcomes, one challenge we face is until we do the research we before you start the building - / when we finally decide what we to build then scope – have a two part process
    * Milestones is a big part of this, we can building in flexibility but we have budget constraints and vendor may have 
    * USDS: leave tech scope out of the contract, and instead nail doing research process and repeatable agile/iterative process, frequent deliverable the gov is getting valuable
    * This is an open conversation with community we want to respond to this
o	Q: when you award a contract do say start tomorrow, we are all small biz and we have resource constraint –give the contractor 2 weeks 
    * It usually takes us a little longer which why I said register sooner 
    * Be clear on the PoP in the solicitation process
    * 3 to 4 weeks is more ideal – 4 weeks seems reasonable – language no later than 4
    * In the list of deliverable we will include language “kick off meeting no later than 2 weeks” we can change that to 4 
o	Q: How can we do phased work
    * We have phased work – prototype; limit the scope
    * Then if that is successful we do follow-on 
    * 2nd way is we can R and D with one vendor and help us understand the solution, with that vendor we build technical requirement and do separate procurement for different vendor to bid on vendor is allowed to stay on a consulting role
o	What are the onboarding requirements for SI
    * We do have background checks but if we you have one file it is faster
    * You get a network account and ID and then you get SI ID
    * Get finger printed for background check – pretty fast 
    * You still work; may need an escort to get into the building 
    * 2 -3 weeks – for background check;
    * If you have done background check in the past it goes thru pretty fast 
    * USDS: vendors, you can also put your timing constraints in your proposals so that the government can plan accordingly

### Group discussion around problem statements

__Group Share Out__    

Table 1  
-	Empathy & education around the history of slavery and freedom in America from 1400 to 1877 needs to be increased through a digital experience. The solution should evolve to encompass and deliver the fully collected, curated body of knowledge available at the NMAAHC

Table 2  
-	We believe that bringing the emotional experience of slavery and freedom exhibition online audience and for those who are seeking to engage African American culture will allow people to connect with African American history and culture to understand how it affects our world today, we will know this is true when we see “American” story becomes the center of the African American story. 

Table 3  
-	How might we elevate and engage the narrative we want to help visitors both online and in person to better connect with and understand the history of slavery and freedom to help us make better decisions today. 

Table 4  
-	How might we engage partners in healthy competition to create a digital experience in one years’ time that conveys the emotional human journey from slavery and freedom that promotes discovery in an inclusive way which is also informed by research and prototyping. 

Reflections from this exercise:
-	It was helpful to have representatives from the museum at the table and able to interview them as we are crafting these statements and lean on their expertise as the subject matter experts to help shape the statement
-	It helped getting to that “why is it important”. Why are we doing this work?  Which is the important first step for research 
-	Initially the “problem” in “problem statement” was confusing because we believe there isn’t really a problem but were able to flip it to an “opportunity statement” and looking at it from that perspective was really interesting
-	We tried to address “problem” but also saw ourselves getting in to the “solution” so we constantly had challenge each other to step back from that

The groups were advised that one of the requirements of the funding for the project is “education”. 
How do we capture more than an exhibit 
-	Understand the scholarship underlying 
-	E.g. there are projects going on in Cornell about fugitive slavery act
-	Being able to connect to other sites, what other resources are out there and what creative ways can we connect our exhibits to those resources?

### Group discussions around evaluation themes

How would you like to pitch this?  
How would like to be evaluated?  

Table 1
-	Three different phases
    * 10 pager on storytelling, design philosophy 
    * Interview
    * Down select 
    * Final piece – written proposal and challenge – vendor would come and do something 
-	Didn’t get to themes on how to evaluate
-  Q (from another group) Was there any discussion on the demo?
-  A (from Table 1): We were thinking just show up and you don’t know what you are doing until you get there and you have 4 hrs to do something 

Table 2  
-	Also phased approach
-	Rather than asking the second phase 
-	Workshop problems instead of demo and producing something
-	Pricing – vendor said it was helpful to know how many people is needed; would help a small biz vendor
-	What kinds of interview would be helpful? Those focused on high level questions
-	If the vendor doesn’t have a SME or someone sensitive about the area (slavery) the museum should consider including someone on that team
-	Past performance = past firm / past performance and past experience (also) should be weighted
-	Flexibility to add surges – adding bonus teams that come in for short time
-	Does the vendor need to hire a project manager or will one be provided?
-	What is negotiable? 

Table 3  
-	Phased challenges
-	Design walkthrough immersive experience – similar to what is in the Slavery and Freedom exhibit now
-	Process solution 
-  Evaluation factors
    * What are parameter of the grant to ensure it is spent correctly
    * What is their approach to evaluating this
    * Underlying tech 
      * How are you building for the future
      * How much is beyond the tech
    * What other skillsets is needed to get this launched

Table 4  
Provide to the following to the vendors  
-	What are our expectations
-	What the museum provides without dictating solution 
-	Different approaches to down selecting
    * White paper
    * Period of time to develop prototype 
    * How can we make this approach effective as an evaluating tool without costing the vendor too much time and cost
    * What is the ROI
-	What would bring difficulty for small newer firms
    * Github repos
    * Suggested not doing a video – too time consuming, too costly
    * Resumes – make sure there a people you can trust on the project 
-	Working with contracting office to clarify any outstanding things during the Q&A period
-	Due Diligence – in lieu of Q and A period 
    * Chance to interview the actual project team 
    * Kind of like down select 
    * Select the ones with highest value, prior to having due diligence sessions
    * Innovate your solution
    * Vendors would like to have the opportunity to interview project team to get clarity to come to best solutions
-	Don’t ask us to write in times new roman 12 but instead think about word count. Why?
    * Limits design 
    * Does not offer an opportunity to showcase design and brand
    * Limits creative flexibility
    * Not legible 

### Closing thoughts  
-	Most of the focus here today has been on figuring how might we help both sides of table to come up with better process that works for all 
-	It took a lot of prep work to come in with open minds and be transparent
-	How might we take some of this and change procurement process
-	We are realizing some the challenge here is language barrier – how do we create consensus 

Final thoughts from USDS  
-	Enjoyed today, it was exciting and new. I have been impressed by how everyone was open and humble about the process
-	Appreciate SI – you guys brought a fully integrated project team – makes the conversation helpful. Representation from all departments and stakeholders. 
-	This whole event took 2.5 months to pull together. Watching this play out has been amazing. Enjoyed good interaction with vendors, as a former contractor, this is usually adversarial. With other procurements at other agencies, it would have been best to share information earlier to avoid adversarial interactions. Hope this procurement approach is the first of many. The exhibit is easy to connect with. There are other projects around government that may not have same emotional draw but deserve same level engagement.
-	Impressed by the level of transparency. Kudos to SI. Rare in government environment. Impressed by SI’s trusting us.

USDS / SI  
-	How do we make something real out of what has happened today?
    * SI: this is a completely new approach in how we do solicitation and vendor engagement. We need some time to sit down and process. What makes sense and how much time involved? Our goal is getting something out this summer and award by end of FY. Two weeks to create RFQ… unclear what the overall timeline looks like. Need time to build out our own process. June = SOO out. July = run procurement process.  Aug = make award. Further details being ironed out with input from the feedback we have heard today. Staying in touch with USDS overall. This was helpful. Disclaimer: if we miss August, 2019 it will add more time.

Retro  
-	Feedback: how we might tell this story to goverment or vendors or larger audience 
-	Take aways from SI:
    * I’ve been waiting all my life for this day – very rewarding day. 
    * Excited about the pre-event day. Absolutely invigorating. Pleasure meeting you all and look forward 
    * Grateful for everyone who helped this event. 
    * Grateful for the experience and thanks for sharing your needs are
    * Think it is going to be helpful. Procurement system is not working well for everyone and we have an opportunity here to make it a lot easier – being more specific, providing templates, etc feel like there are things we can do right now to make the process better 
    * This model is helpful for how we ultimately put together something that help us put together better proposals 

Takeaways industry  
-	Grateful for the tour, work, content in the exhibit was amazing. Thanks for the experience!
-	Fantastic day. The work you do here is incredible. The opportunity to do this work is so impactful. As designer we want to help solve the challenges without the prescriptiveness of the procurement process.
-	Being able to come together and not have that adversarial relationship
-	Never been so deeply involved so upstream in the process. Being able to talk before foundational decisions are made is so incredible. Sets everyone up for success. 

The groups were asked to reflect on the following in the coming days:  
-	What could we have done better?
-	What are things that we have missed?

What do we do next? Maybe smaller group conversations. How might do this differently, maybe 2 day session instead of one day like today.
